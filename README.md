# Past Client
- Past Client is a Minecraft Utility Mod for 1.12.2, that runs with Minecraft Forge. 
- It features helpful mods for anarchy servers, like 2b2t/9b9t ect.
- Don't expect the best coding practices being used here, I'll do my best to improve!

# Credits

- I made sure to credit all the original code authors in the specified class in a comment, but just for good measure, I'll put them here as well.
