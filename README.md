## Past
* This project was started by olliem5 in September 2020, to become more familiar with Java.
* I don't recommend using this client as reference code for your own client, or to use it as a base for a client, due to most of the code being bad and outdated (as of 22/12/20).

#### Going Forward
* This client will not be updated very frequently, but I do plan to slowly rewrite most of the old & bad code (most of it), and add new features once that is done.

#### Planned Features that might get done
* Rewrite setting system w/ colour support & sub setting support
* GUI animations & colour picker component
* Proper system for rendering, maybe a GUI component for that as well
* Make the font system actually good & switch to slick for rendering
* Make the HUD system good with changing based on screen position
* JSON config system (WIP)

#### Credits
* When creating this, I used other open-source projects as refrence code, or used a bit of code from them. They are listed below, and in the class with the code.
