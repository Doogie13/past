## Past
* This project was started by olliem5 in September 2020, to become more familiar with Java.
* I don't recommend using this client as reference code for your own client, or to use it as a base for a client, due to most of the code being outdated.

#### Going Forward
* I will no longer be maintaining this client, if someone else wants to, contributions will always be welome.

#### Credits
* When creating this, I used other open-source projects as refrence code, or used a bit of code from them. They are listed below, and in the class with the code.

* [Kami](https://github.com/zeroeightysix/KAMI)
* [Wurst+2](https://github.com/TrvsF/wurstplus-two)
* [SalHack](https://github.com/ionar2/spidermod)
* [GameSense](https://github.com/IUDevman/gamesense-client)

* If you feel that I have not credited you properly, please, let me know on Discord (ollie#0057), and I'll add it in a comment, as well as here.
