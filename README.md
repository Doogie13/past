## Past Utility Mod
* This project was started by olliem5 in September 2020, to become more familiar with Java.
* Past is a Minecraft Forge Utility Mod for 1.12.2. 
* It features helpful "tweaks" for anarchy servers, like 2b2t/9b9t ect.
* Don't expect the best coding practices being used here, old code will be updated if needed.

#### Going Forward
* As of this client becoming public and open source, me and some others have started another private project.
* I will continue to update Past whenever I get the time, primarily focusing making the existing features as best as they can be, and then moiving on to other aspects of the client.

#### TODO before public release
* Function for string width in FontUtil.java
* Code cleanup
* Rewrite settings!
* GUI Animations

#### Planned for the future
* Colour setting and a GUI colour picker component
* Sub settings

#### Installing
* Past is a Minecraft Forge mod, which requires Minecraft Forge to be installed.
* Download the latest Past release from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/olliem5/past/releases).
* Go to [Forge's Website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html) and download Forge for `1.12.2`. I would recommend version `14.23.5.2854`.
* Once Forge is installed, go to where your `.minecraft` folder is located, and make a folder called `mods` if one already does not exist.
* If you already have other Minecraft Forge versions installed, make sure to make another folder called `1.12.2` within the `mods` folder.  
* Put the Past jar file in the folder and launch the Forge Minecraft instance!

## Credits
* While creating this, I looked at many other open-source projects to use as reference code, or to use a snippet of code from it, such as a util.
* I made sure to credit all the original code authors in the specified class in a comment, but just for good measure, I'll put them here as well.
